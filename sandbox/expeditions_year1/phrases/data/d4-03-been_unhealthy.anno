%%-begin-anno-text-%% Well, I hate to say it, but I've been unhealthy. I thought because I was doing a lot of exercising and training, I could just eat unhealthy snacks and be okay. But now my wings aren't any bigger and my tummy feels weird and all the other dragons seem to be flying around more volcanoes than me for the dragon race. Did you ever feel bad about something like that?
